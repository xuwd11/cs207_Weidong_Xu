# Milestone 1 Code Review
---

** Please arrive *at least* ten minutes before your scheduled time slot. **
---

## Format
Each group will be given 11 minutes to demo their code.  The teach staff will ask basic 
questions about design choices and point out where the code can be improved.  The demo 
should include a "tour" through the code that touches on the Milestone 1 requirements.  
For example, the group should show the model doc, documentation, and demo the test 
suite.  The teaching staff will provide a few input files to make sure the code responds 
properly.
