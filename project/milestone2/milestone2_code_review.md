# Milestone 2 Code Review
---

** Please arrive *at least* ten minutes before your scheduled time slot. **
---

## Format
Each group will be given 11 minutes to demo their code.

In the first 5 minutes, the teaching staff will attempt to install the library, 
run the tests, and run the code with an input file.  To make the process 
efficient, it is advisable to provide a demo script so the teaching staff can 
simply input a new input file and run the demo.  The demo should return the 
reaction rates of the species.

In the second 5 minutes, the group should pitch their proposed feature.  Try 
to explain what the feature is and how you will implement it.  We want to be 
sure that the feature is feasible but substantial enough that you use the 
ideas introduced in the course.  Remember, the teaching staff has access to 
your model doc, which should contain a detailed description of the proposed 
feature.
