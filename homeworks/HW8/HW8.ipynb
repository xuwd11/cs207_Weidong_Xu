    "\n",
    "[Markov Chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) are widely used to model and predict discrete events. Underlying Markov chains are Markov processes which make the assumption that the outcome of a future event only depends on the event immediately preceeding it. In this exercise, we will be assuming that weather has Markov properties (e.g. today's weather is dependent only on yesterday's weather). We will use the Markov assumption to create a basic model for predicting weather."
