    "## Problem 1\n",
    "The file `circles.txt` contains measurements of circle radii.  Your task is to write a script that reports the average area of the circles.  You will **not** use the `numpy` `mean` function.  Here are the requirements:\n",
    "1. Open `circles.txt`, read in the data, and convert the data to floats.\n",
    "2. Write a function that computes the area of a circle.\n",
    "3. Write a function, called `myave`, that computes the average of the areas of the circles.  At the very least, `myave` should accept the list of radii as one argument and the circle function that you wrote in step 2 as another argument.  There are other ways of doing this task, but I want you to do it this way.\n",
    "4. Print out the result."

    "## Problem 2\n",
    "The goal of this problem is to write a simple bank account withdraw system.  The problem is based off of one in _Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:** Do each part in a different cell block and clearly label each part.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1\n",
    "Write a closure to make withdraws from a bank account.  The outer function should be accept the initial balance as an argument (I'll refer to this argument as `balance` in this problem statement, but you can call it whatever you want).  The inner function should accept the withdraw amount as an argument and return the new balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE1:** For this part, do not try to reassign `balance` in the inner function.  Just see what happens when you return a new balance.  You can store the new balance in a new name (call it `new_bal` if you want) or just return the new balance directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE2:** You may want to check for basic exceptions (e.g. attempting to withdraw more than the current balance).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you write your functions, demo them in your notebook as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "wd = make_withdraw(init_balance)\n",
    "wd(withdraw_amount)\n",
    "wd(new_withdraw_amount)\n",
    "```\n",
    "You should observe that this does not behave correctly.  Why not?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2\n",
    "You can fix things up by updating `balance` within the inner function.  But this won't work.  Try it out and explain why it doesn't work.  Try to use the language that we used in lecture.  **Hint:** [Python Execution Model](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 3\n",
    "Now, make just one small change to your code from Part 2.  Declare `balance` as a nonlocal variable using the nonlocal keyword.  That is, make the first line of the inner function, say `nonlocal balance`.  Here's some information on the `nonlocal` statement:  [`nonlocal`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#nonlocal).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now test things out like you did in Part 1.  It should be behaving correctly now.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 4\n",
    "Finally, visualize your code with [Python Tutor](http://pythontutor.com/) and embed your visualization in your notebook.  Pay attention to the variable `balance`."

    "## Problem 3\n",
    "Let's return to the data from Problem 1.  Write two functions: 1.) The first function should return the average circle area (you can re-use the one you already wrote if you'd like, but you might need to update it slightly for this problem) and 2.) The second function should just use `numpy` to compute the average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a decorator to time the evaluation of each function.  You can use the timing decorator from lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes and Hints\n",
    "1. Be fair!\n",
    "2. To be as fair as possible, do the following:\n",
    "  1. Create an areas list/array _outside_ of your averaging functions.  This means that you should do a loop over the radii you read in from `circles.txt`, compute the area from each point, and store that area in an array.  Do you know why this is more fair?  Also, try to not use `append`.  Instead, preallocate space for your `area` list/array.\n",
    "  2. Your `my_ave` function should accept your areas data as a list.  Remember, to allocate a list you should do `[0.0]*N`: if you use such a construct your list will will be filled in with zeros.\n",
    "  3. Your `np_ave` function should accept your areas data as a `numpy` array.  To allocate a `numpy` array do `areas_np = np.zeros(len(radii))`.\n",
    "  4. Now both functions are using the best data types possible for their tasks."

    "Write a decorator to check if a quantity returned from a function is positive.  An exception should be raised if the quantity is not positive.\n",

    "Write three functions and decorate them with your decorator:\n",
    "1. A function that returns the discriminant $\\displaystyle d = b^{2} - 4ac$\n",
    "2. A function that computes the absolute value (you must write this yourself...do not use built-ins)\n",
    "3. A function of your own choosing.\n",

    "1. A case where positivity is not violated\n",
    "2. A case where positivity is violated"
