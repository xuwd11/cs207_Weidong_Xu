    "The whole point of this problem was to show you how to get your local repo back to an earlier state.  In this exercise, you accidentally merged something to `master` that you didn't want.  Rather than starting to delete things all over the place, you can simply reset your `HEAD` to a previous commit."

Suppose I've made an error in this homework (or a lecture) and want to correct it. I fix the mistake in the upstream repo. In the meantime you have edited some other files and you really don't want to manually ignore my older copies of those files. Rather, you want to fix just one file from this new branch. This is how you do it.\n",
