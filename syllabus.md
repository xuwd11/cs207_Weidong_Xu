## Learning Objectives

After successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

* Use Python, including its advanced features to write scientific programs

* Understand what features of Python (or for that matter any programming language) make up its language 
  execution model and how these features impact the code you write: e.g. how modularity, abstraction, and 
  encapsulation can be used to solve problems

* Write these programs with good software engineering practices

* Code data management techniques to store data, staring from a good understanding of data structures.

* Combine these techniques together to write large pieces of software (you will do a group project for this), 
  working in a team of scientists, programmers, etc.

* Evaluate and test software to see which one your group ought to use. 

* Be a capable unicorn: able to contribute on both the science and software engineering sides of things.

* Hit the road running as a scientist. 

## Course Topics

The primary goal of this course is to teach you how to develop effective software for scientific applications. In 
order to achieve this goal, there are several non-negotiable topics that must be included in the course.  We 
will focus on _System and Software Engineering_ and _Language_.  Morevoer, we aim to provide you with a suite of 
modern software development techniques and workflows.  The following list includes topics that will be covered in 
this course.  See the [Course Schedule](schedule.md) for details on how the topics fit together.

* Version control
* Python (basics)
* How Python works
* Software documentation
* Software testing 
* Object-oriented programming
* Data structures 
* Databases

## Lecture Attendance

Lecture attendance is mandatory and essential.  A large portion of lecture time will be spent writing programs and
working in groups.  In order to encourage participation, students will be required to present solutions to in-class 
exercises.

Attendance at guest lectures is mandatory and will be checked by passing around sign-in sheets.

## Textbooks

There is no required course textbook.  However, the course content will draw from various sources.  We will cite the 
source when appropriate.  Please consult the [Resources Page](resources.md) for recommended textbooks and additional resources. 

## Assessment Procedure

Refer to the Coursework page for specific details on the grading scheme for the homeworks and groupwork policies.

The project page has a breakdown of the project.

**Course Grade Breakdown**
* Homework:  20%
* In-class Exercises:  20%
* Class participation:  10%
* Project: 50%

## Exams

We will not have standard midterm or final exams.  Instead, we will have a midterm presentation on project 
progress and a final project presentation during the scheduled final exam period.  Details on the project 
can be found on the project page.

## Prerequisites

Programming knowledge **in Python** at the level of CS50 and CS 109 (or above). Besides this, you should 
have interest or investment in scientific computing.

## Academic Integrity

You are welcome to discuss the course's material and homework with others in order to better understand it, 
but the work you turn in must be your own unless collaboration is explicitly allowed. You may not submit the 
same or similar work to this course that you have submitted or will submit to another. You must acknowledge 
any source code that was not written by you by mentioning the original author(s) directly in your source code 
(comment or header). You can also acknowledge sources in a README.txt file if you used whole classes or libraries. 
Do not remove any original copyright notices and headers. For more information please consult the Harvard academic 
integrity guidelines: 
[Academic Integrity and Academic Dishonesty](https://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/book/academic-integrity#two). All 
forms of academic dishonesty will be forwarded to the Harvard College Administrative Board.

## Special Accommodations

If you have a documented disability (physical or cognitive) that may impair your ability to complete assignments 
or otherwise participate in the course and satisfy course criteria, please meet with us at your earliest convenience 
to identify, discuss, and document any feasible instructional modifications or accommodations. You should also 
contact the Accessible Education Office to request an official letter outlining authorized accommodations. The 
Extension School is committed to providing an accessible academic community. The Disability Services Office offers 
a variety of accommodations and services to students with documented disabilities. Please visit 
[this webpage](www.extension.harvard.edu/resources-policies/resources/disability-services-accessibility) for more 
information.
