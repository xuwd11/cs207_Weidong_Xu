    "Write a function to compute the roots of a mathematical equation of the form\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  ax^{2} + bx + c = 0.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "Your function should be sensitive enough to adapt to situations in which a user might accidentally set $a=0$, or $b=0$, or even $a=b=0$.  For example, if $a=0, b\\neq 0$, your function should print a warning and compute the roots of the resulting linear function.  It is up to you on how to handle the function header: feel free to use default keyword arguments, variable positional arguments, variable keyword arguments, or something else as you see fit.  Try to make it user friendly.\n",

    "**Hint:** Quadratic equations can have complex roots of the form $r = a + ib$ where $i=\\sqrt{-1}$ (Python uses the notation $j=\\sqrt{-1}$).  To deal with complex roots, you should import the `cmath` library and use `cmath.sqrt` when computing square roots.  `cmath` will return a complex number for you.  You could handle complex roots yourself if you want, but you might as well use available libraries to save some work."
