    "## Exercise 2\n",
    "This exercise will walk you through the creation of a dictionary.\n",
    "1. First, load the data in the `names.txt` file.  This file contains common names of some species.  Load this into a list.\n",
    "2. Do the same thing with the `species.txt` file.  This file contains chemical formulae for some species.\n",
    "3. Now create a dictionary where the data from `names.txt` are the values and the data from `species.txt` are the keys.\n",
    "  + You should automate the creation of the dictionary by using a `for` loop\n",
    "  + The `for` loop should iterate over the representation created by the `zip` function. You can refer to the example around line 32 in Lecture 4 for guidance.\n",
    "  + **HINT:** Initialize the dictionary by with `my_new_dict = {}` just before executing the `for` loop.\n",
    "4. Access a value from the dictonary and print it to the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The same dictionary can be created by executing the following one-liner:  `species_dict_2 = dict(zip(species, names))`."
